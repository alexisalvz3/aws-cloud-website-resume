# Cloud Resume Challenge

This project showcases my skills in cloud computing and web development through the implementation of a dynamic, serverless resume website. 
Leveraging AWS services, I deployed a static website on S3, distributed via CloudFront for optimal performance. The site features a visitor counter powered by a Lambda function, 
which interacts with a DynamoDB table to store and retrieve visit counts. Infrastructure is managed as code using Terraform, ensuring reproducibility and scalability. 
The front-end is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the back-end utilizes Python for the Lambda function. This project demonstrates proficiency in AWS services (S3, CloudFront, Lambda, DynamoDB), 
IaC with Terraform, and full-stack development practices, all while adhering to cloud architecture best practices.
